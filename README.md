# RainC lassification and Climate Change

Data Analysis project about rain classification and climate change.

## About the data used

The data used can be found and downloaded in [Visual Crossing](https://www.visualcrossing.com/).

## About the code

The code is written in Python and saved as Notebooks. The following dependencies must be satisfied to execute the notebooks:

1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn
5. Sklearn
6. Statsmodel
7. Scipy

There are two notebooks:

1. *ProcessData.ipynb:* In this notebook a general processing of the data is performed. Then all the tasks about the rain classification are also computed.
2. *ProcessDataClimateChange.ipynb:* In this second notebook only the processing needed for the climate change part of the project is done. Then also all the climate change calculations are performed.
